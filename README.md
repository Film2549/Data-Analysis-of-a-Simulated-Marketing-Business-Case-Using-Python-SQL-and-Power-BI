# Data Analysis of a Simulated Marketing Business Case Using Python, SQL and Power BI

##  Overview

This project is inspired by a Youtube tutorial, where I apply and adapt the skills I've learned to analyze data from a simulated business scenario with a dataset made up of several tables. The goal is to solve three major business problems by finding insights and proposing possible solution. The process involves using data analysis skills and tools, including SQL (via SQL Server), Python, and PowerBI to analyze, clean and visualize the data. 

This project helps me understand the process, learn how to use programming languages in working pplication, and identify my mistakes to improve. It also shows me how data analysis can help solve real-world business challenges.

From reading above, I set that KPIs are 

- **Conversion Rate** : Percentage of website visitors who make a purchase.
- **Customer Engagement Rate** : Level of interaction with marketing content (clicks, likes, comments)
- **Customer Feedback Score** : Average rating from customer reviews.

So I provided my golds are
- **Increase Conversion Rates** : Identify factors impacting the conversion rate and provide recommendations to improve it.
- **Enhance Customer Engagement** : Determine which types of content make the highest engagement. 
- **Improve Customer Feedback Scores** : Understand common themes in customer reviews and provid actionable insights.
